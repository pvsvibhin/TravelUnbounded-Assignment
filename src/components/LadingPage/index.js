          November is one of the Best times to visit Kenya, especially to visit
          its prime park,This is because the large migratory herds would have
          returned to Tanzania and now the Big cats have to venture long
          distances to hunt their prey.November is also the season of short
          rains. This makes the plains of Maasai Mara lush green. The skies are
          truly dramatic and colourful.The Sun rise and Sun sets during November
          at Mara is simply breath taking. November is also a time for
          holidaying and getting together with our families. And the icing on
          the cake is we have curated this itinerary for such an affordable
